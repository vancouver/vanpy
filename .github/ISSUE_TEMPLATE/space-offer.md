The vanpy user group needs space to meet up and chat, so we are always on the lookout for a space. You could offer space for one event, or ongoing.

If you are filling out this form with an offer to host an event, a big thank you from the organizers. We need your help to make this happen. ðŸ™‡

## What we need to know
Please replace the bits below with your information ðŸ‘‡

* **Who:** Company name etc.
* **Contact info:** We are going to assume its you, but it might be someone else. Don't put anyones personal information here though, this is public ðŸ˜€
* **Where:** Where the space is so we can get there.
* **When:** Is this limited to a particular time period, or just open for anytime?

**What you as the organiser needs to know**
We are just a bunch of amazing people who want to hang out and talk about Python. As such there's not much we need, but do need you to check off the following are all cool: ðŸ˜Ž

* [ ] A space that is welcome to all people of gender, nationality etc please see [our code of conduct](https://github.com/vancouver/vanpy/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).
* [ ] Space for people to sit, usually 12 - 50 (depending how many people come).
* [ ] Easyish for people to get to (Vancouver and downtown, near public transit for example).
* [ ] Good wifi for presentations and demos and so people can join remotely.
* [ ] A big screen we can connect a laptop to for presentations and demos.
* [ ] Washroom access.

If you are company sponsoring the event by giving us some space, thank you. If you are hiring, or have a specific tool people might be interested in, then we can give you a slide or two or a minute or so at the end of the talk. That's cool by us.

Things that we can't do: ðŸ˜­
* Sign non-disclosures or other agreements to hang out there.
* Any sort of insurance requirements.
* Pay for things.
