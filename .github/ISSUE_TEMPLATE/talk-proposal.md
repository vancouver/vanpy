Anyone is welcome to talk on any topic. In the past we've talks on a super wide range of topics and we'd welcome anyone, from those new to giving talks to those experience conference speakers. Talks can be from 5-45 mins long. I mean you could do longer if you want...

* **Description**: The longer version of the above.
* **Duration (approx.)**: We aren't going to hold you to his, don't worry. But if its short, it means we can get in a few talks in one meeting.
