The [Vancouver Python User Group](http://www.meetup.com/vanpyz/) is a
volunteer-run community of Python users based in Vancouver, BC Canada.

This repository is the primary source of information about the user group and we'll try to deprecate the old meetup groups of DjangoVan https://www.meetup.com/djangovan and VanPyz https://www.meetup.com/vanpyz/ into this one repository.
