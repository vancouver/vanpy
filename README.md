## About

The primary place for Python users in Vancouver, BC to get involved in the community. Come to events and meet other Python users.

This user group has been running in some format for over 24 years ðŸŽ‰ and we hope to keep it going.

## Organizers

Andy McKay: [@andymckay](https://github.com/andymckay/)

We are looking for more people to help volunteer to organize and run meetings. It really doesn't take much time, so please help out of you can.

### Previous organizers 

* Bryan Chow
* Seb Vetter

And many more. Thank you for your work in the past keeping this going.

## Meeting types

One of the goals of the user group is to provide social and networking chances for Python users, so most meetings will have:
* a quick round of intros
* a chance to ask questions
* a pop out for a drink afterwards

### Round table

These are meetings where we don't have a speaker but go round the table asking people to speak on a topic that interests them. Hopefully about Python ðŸ˜Š

It could be something cool you've learnt, something that happened recently in the community. We generaly aim for about 5 minutes per person but it will vary.

### Speaker 

When we have a speaker, we'll normally devote 45 minutes to that talk. Add in some time to chat befoee and after as noted.

We welcome anyone who wants to speak as long as they agree to the groups guidelines. If you'd like to speak, please file an issue ðŸ™‡
